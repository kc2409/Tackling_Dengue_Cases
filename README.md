# Tackling Dengue Cases
## Project Details:
**Domain:** Machine Learning           
**Project Name:** Tackling Dengue Cases

## Project Description:
**The Problem:**
Dengue has worsened in Delhi with more than 5,000 cases in 2021, making it the highest number of cases of vector-borne disease recorded in the city in a year since 2015. Dengue is spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito which breeds in damp locations and stagnant water pools.

## Aim:
We will create a dengue information website that shows the predictions of dengue cases in Delhi in the upcoming months from real time data such as climate (precipitation, humidity and temperature) giving an advanced indicator of when dengue will emerge and satellite data that will determine the potential dengue hotspots. Through our website people can contact the local government officials in case their area lies in the potential dengue hotspots in order to take necessary actions.


## Data Description:
1. To predict number of dengue cases: We used web scrapping in order to find the number of monthly dengue cases and climate details (precipitation, humidity and temperature) in    Delhi. 
2. To obtain sattelite data: We used QGIS to extract Senital 2 sattelite images
